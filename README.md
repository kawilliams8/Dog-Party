Dog Party is the first project in Mod 1 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Learning Goals
1. Practice accurately building a comp
1. Write well structured, semantic HTML
1. Craft clean, DRY CSS
1. Try out working with Javascript to interact with the DOM

## Phase One: Basic Requirements
Step 1
Start by building the HTML and using semantic tags to create a clean structure for your page. Work to craft your HTML according to the Turing HTML Style Guide

Step 2
Style your site using CSS – aim to get it as visually close to the comp as possible. Work to craft your CSS according to the Turing CSS Style Guide

Step 3
Create a README.md file that gives a brief overview of your project (don’t forget to make sure to include the comp as well as a screen grab of your finished site!)

## Phase Two: More Better
We won’t cover how to do these in class before this project ends – challenge yourself and investigate how to tackle these tasks. And remember: it is ok if you’re not sure how to do these so take a crack at it and experiment, we’ll go over this material together soon!

Step 1 - CSS
Make your Dog Party site mobile. Experiment using your DevTools and media queries
How could you handle the links in the nav bar? Maybe change them into a menu icon?
How will you handle the columns? Will they still fit if they are in 3 columns?
Make the What Is Dog buttons horizontally aligned no matter how much text is in each column.

Step 2 - Javascript
Once you have the HTML structure built and styled using CSS, experiment with adding in interaction using Javascript: Build functionality to allow a user to type a dog name in the input field and then, when the user clicks the button, have that dog name replace the text Some Dogs in the main A Site About Some Dogs header and clear out the input field. For example: if I typed Fido into the input, when I click the button the main header of the page should change to read A Site About Fido.
Work to craft your Javascript according to the Turing Javascript Style Guide
